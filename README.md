# This is Jiawei Liu(aka Ganler)

"Ganler" means 甘楽 in Chinese/Japanese, which is from my favorite animation デュラララ!!(DURARARA!!).

Usually I spend 100% of my time coding, 100% of my time watching animations/movies, and another -100% of my time sleeping.

In this year(2020), I am building high-performance machine learning systems(HyperPose@TensorLayer, Model Server@ByteDance).
